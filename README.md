# Motion-Control-Path-Generator

This repo contains a Path Generator Java GUI run in Eclipse workspace. The xml paths generated by this program are read by the Motion-Control project (repo here: https://github.com/Michaelszeng/Motion-Control).

There are a few .xml files that are actual example paths generated by the program.
